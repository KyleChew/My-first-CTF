Testing log
Enviroment Analysis
The first step I did is making sure that both enviroment network settings are set to NAT, then
I ran zenmap with the command “192.168.197. *” to find the ip address of the target virtual
machine, next I ran the command “masscan 192.168.197.129/32 --rate=10000” to show all the open
ports on the ip address and nmap “192.168.197.129 -p- -sV -A” with the –p- command meaning to
scan all the ports , -sV meaning verbrose which is to state the status while scaning the ports and -A
meaning to detect the operating system and its version.After that I tried accessing all the services to
make sure that they are working correctly which then I discover there is an open http port ,I then
used nikto command “nikto –h 192.168.197.129” to search for directories.

Exploit Attempts
Exploit Database
With the information found, I found that proFTPD service is outdated and it is vulnerable to
SQL injection which manipulates the “%” symbol, which leads me to use the command on the user 
coloumn “USER %') and 1=2 union select 1,1, uid, gid, homedir, shell from users; --“and the password
of “1”.
Same goes for Dovecot IMAP which takes advantage of a special configuration to prints out
all the emails that is set to the option. I attempt to transfer perl and ruby code that was on the
exploit database website in to metasploit console in order to use its feature to execute the exploit.

Web Attacks
After the discovery of the webpage directory which leads to an admin login page I tried to
perform an SQL injection attack as well as insecure direct object reference attack on the webpage.
The attempted commands are “‘; DROP DATABASE MAIN_DATABASE; --“and
“http://192.168.197.129/admin/index.php?include=/./../../../../etc/passwd”.

Metasploit Framework
Another way of finding exploits is to use a tool called metasploitable which has a bunch of
exploit save in the software, using that I attempted to find exploits for proFTPD, Dovecot, Apache
2.2.8 and distcc services with the command “msfconsole” to activate the framework, “search
distccd” and “use exploit/unix/misc/distcc_exec” for each of the services.
