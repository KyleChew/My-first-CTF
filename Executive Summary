Executive Summary
The goal of this case study is to shows methods and techniques to infiltrate a system, attain
privileges in the system and show how data can be extracted from these attacks. The provided
system will contain 5 flags; each flag will represent valuable data scattered inside the system. I
separate the investigation into phases to show the difference steps, with the phases consisting of
finding services and its version, assesing the vulnerability of the system, exploit and attacking the
system, evaluate the data found from the exploit and documentation.
The first flag was achieve using a network reconnaissance software to seek out the service
available inside the system and used exploit against outdated and vulnerable service, I was able to
extract data such as username, password and most of the files inside the sytem. With the
credential found on the system I was able to find the second flag via accessing a service call FTP
which is used to store data when crossing destination as well as an encrypted password file. After
cracking the password file with a software called john I was able to access another service called SSH
which is used to securely access a computer system over the network, inside the service I found
more credentials, backend SQL database code for a website that can be easily modified and insert
my own credenetials as well as flag number three. By modifying the database to put in my own
credential, I was able to access the webpage with the highest privilege and obtain flag four. The
last flag was attainned by using a shell injection attack which manipulates the system to read the
commands using a badly coded network ping service.
