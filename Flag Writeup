I was able to access a shell terminal using the exploit provided by metasploitable towards a
tcp service called distccd. i then navigate using the command “pwd” to find out where I was,
navigate to the home directory with “ls” and found flag1 as well as a notes text file. i open the flag
and notes file with “cat” command, in the notes file was username: bak and password:

During the exploration of the shell, I accessed “var/log/proftpd/xferlog” and determine that
the credential given from the note is from the proftpd 1.3.1 FTP logins. When I successfully log in to
FTP it shows an etc.old directory and flag2 text file. I was able to download the flag to a local
machine and open it there. On the etc.old directory I managed to find a shadow file containing
password of users in the system encrypted and salted.

Flag 3 – Password Cracking

Method 1
After I found the credential on flag1 I used the command “cd .. “ a few times to navigate to
root directory and check every single folder in the system. On the directory “/var/mysql/”, I was able
to find flag3.

Flag 4 – mySQL database

What else is in the FTP storage was a folder named “gnb”, that’s what the webpage is called
in the HTTP service and inside the gnb folder contain “user.MYD”, “user.MYI”, “users.frm”. After a bit
of googling it seems that the files inside gnb is a database. I then downloaded the database,
reconstruct it using “mysql –u root –p”. On the database it shows two account, with the first
username: NULL, password: NULL and username: admin, password:
8e5c54ad68df29cc6086bd30f7c8f342 . I was not able to crack the md5 password for admin so I
decided to add another credential so that it logs in with the username and password that I created. I
tried doing this in the FTP service by deleting and reuploading the modified databse .However it goes
back to the original login page after succesfully login and using the network ping feature , switching
to SSH works fine after logins .The SQL command that I used is “show databases;” to show all the
database , “use gnb” to use the selected database ,”show table” to show all the tables in the
database,”SELECT * FROM users;” to show all the values in the database and “INSERT INTO users
(username,password) VALUES ('admin2','81dc9bdb52d04dc20036dbd8313ed055');” to insert my
own credential with ‘”81dc9bdb52d04dc20036dbd8313ed055” as an md5 of “1234” string.After that I access the page using the credential that I created and it shows flag 4 and an IP
ping service.

With the IP ping service, I was able to conduct a shell injection attack by manipulating it with
a semi colon “;’ after the IP address in order put in the commands I wish. What it means is to
execute the two commands which is to run the pinging test as well as the command afterwards. The
command I used is “127.0.0.1 ; whoami;” to find out the user I was connected , the system replied
with “root” which means that I probably have full privillege on the system. After that I ran the command “127.0.0.1 ; pwd;” to determine where I was which it replied
“/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/admin”.I then relocate to home directory and check to see what files is on the system with
“127.0.0.1; ls /root”, the system shows the flag 5 and with the command “127.0.0.1; cat /root/flag5”
I was able to retrieve the flag.
