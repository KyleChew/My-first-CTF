Recommendation
In my opinioin the first action to take is to update distCCD service or replace it with a more
secure form of tcp service immediately, the current version is highly vulnerable to exploits and risk
having all the data on the system getting stole .Additionally,important usernames and password
should not be stored on the system especially on an unencrypted text file leaving it publicly on the
desktop, this will lead to all other services, account, web logins getting access without consent.I
believe passwords for a banking firm should not be a simple one letter word and can be found in
the dictionary e.g. cupcakes which can be easily brute forced or cracked using tools like patator,
dictionary attack , or john.Some better password would be cupcakes.1, cupcaks24 , CuPcaKES_52
etc.This would significantly increase the cracking time and make it nearly impossible to be bruteforce .Another advice is to not leave database accessible in secure shell or terminate remote access
to the database after using it on a SSH service, this would prevent it getting all the credential or
sensitive information in the database getting accessed,modified or stolen .The network ping test on
the webpage is badly coded and contain no security protocols , it is vulnerable to a simple shell
injection attack and can be easily manipulated just by inserting a semi colon after the IP address , it
should incorporate some form of web application security such as the admin login page that inserts
a slash right after each asterisk.
